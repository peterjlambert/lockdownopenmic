This week we're introducing a new feature to the open mic: <strong>Lockdown Open Mic - The Game</strong>. Everyone can play along at home - performers and audience members alike - it's fun for all the family!

You don't need anything special to play, or to prepare anything beyond what you would normally prepare for open mic night. The game just runs in a browser tab, or even on your phone, so you can play along without switching away from the action. Just show up here next Tuesday and there'll be a link to open up <strong>Lockdown Open Mic - The Game</strong>
