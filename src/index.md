Ever feel lonesome or blue? Well it must be time for a Lockdown Open Mic Theme Week! This week's theme will be 'Joy'. Songs of happiness, songs of fun, songs of love that hasn't left and songs that make you smile when you sing them.

They don't have to be up tempo, they just have to be not sad. Smiles all around!
