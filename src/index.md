description: Amateur musicians, poets, comics, plate-spinners. Got an urge to perform in this time of social distancing and isolation? Weâ€™re here for you. The pubs and clubs might be closed and your favourite local open-mic night sadly on hiatus but you can join our friendly virtual, online open mic and share in the entertainment. Anything goes; singing, acoustic music, spoken word, comedy. Whatever you've got, we'd love to see it.

It's time for another Lockdown Open Mic theme week. This week we become ROCKdown Open Mic. Bring your best rock covers (and originals if you like). From AC/DC to ZZ Top. Chuck Berry to Throwing Muses. Bon Jovi to Bombalarina (actually, probably not them). Let's hear your own spin on some classics and let's rock! ðŸ¤˜
