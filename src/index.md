  Amateur musicians, poets, comics, plate-spinners. Got an urge to perform in this time of social isolation? Weâ€™re here for you. The pubs and clubs are closed and your favourite local open-mic night is sadly on hiatus. Join our friendly virtual, online open mic and share in the entertainment. Anything goes; singing, acoustic music, spoken word, comedy. Whatever you've got, we'd love to see it.

Over the last twenty four weeks we've heard hundreds of songs on the Lockdown Open Mic. All of them have been amazing. On our 25th show, Lockdown Open Mic regulars will perform songs <em>previously performed</em> by other Lockdown Open Mic-ers.

As always, non-regulars and audience members are encouraged to join in. We're easy going - perform your own thing if you want. But if you want to join in the theme, [Here's a Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1rAMjvYuCi4OFfrGSnT6Vc?si=7p4YW5FwSFeD8jb52G3Qzw) of some of the songs we've had so far.
