  <h2>How do I join in?</h2>
  <p>
    We use <a href="https://zoom.us" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zoom</a> for the Lockdown Open Mic - an app
    available for every platform, phone, tablet, desktop, smart fridge, lawnmower etc. (<a href="#zoomTips"
      >Click here for tips on using Zoom for playing music and make sure you enable 'Original Sound)</a

    Before each event, I’ll put a link to the Zoom room on this website and it’ll be in the
    calendar invite too. Then you just need to turn up any time from 8pm (UK time), turn on your camera, mute your
    mic, then if you want to perform let me know in the Zoom text chat and I'll put you on the list - just like a
    real open mic!

    We'll do one song per performer at a time and move around the group to keep things flowing. Make sure you tell
    me in the chat when you join if you want to perform.
