  <h2>How do I join in?</h2>
  <p>
    This is something that might change from event to event until we figure out the best way of doing this, but
    for the time being, we’re going to use <a href="https://zoom.us" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zoom</a> - an app
    available for every platform, phone, tablet, desktop, smart fridge, etc. (<a href="#zoomTips"
      >Click here for tips on using Zoom for playing music)</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Before each event, I’ll put a link to the Zoom call on this website, on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/lockdownopenmic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Twitter</a>, on
    <a href="https://instagram.com/lockdownopenmic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Instagram</a>, and it’ll be in the
    calendar invite notes too. Then you just need to turn up at the right time, turn on your camera, mute your
    mic, then if you want to perform let me know in the Zoom text chat and I'll put you on the list - just like a
    real open mic!
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll do one song per performer at a time and move around the group to keep things flowing. Make sure you tell
    me in the chat when you join if you want to perform.
