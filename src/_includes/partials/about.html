  <h2>What's this now?</h2>
  <p>
    Musicians, poets, comics, plate-spinners; have you got an urge to perform in this time of social isolation? Lockdown Open Mic is here
    for you. Playing live music in pubs and clubs is still a no-go, and your favourite local open-mic night is sadly on haitus. Join our
    virtual open-mic and share your talent with an appreciative crowd.
  </p>
  <p>
    We started Lockdown Open Mic as an online version of your favourite local open mic nights way back at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. Over time we've grown into an amazing community of performers, audience members and new friends from the UK and across the World. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We're a friendly bunch, extrmely welcoming to new performers and with zero pressure to perform at all (we have plenty of people who just join for a weekly dose of live entertainment)</p>
  </p>
  <p>  
  Seriously. Everybody's welcome; from seasoned performers to first-timers - come and give it a go.

  <h2>Is this for me?</h2>
  <p>
    I dunno. Do you like to play an instrument, sing, write poetry or make people laugh? Got an urge to perform
    for others but canâ€™t because of the lockdown? Want to share an experience with some like-minded folk? Just want to watch some live music on a Tuesday? Then
    yes, this could be for you. Why not give it a try?
