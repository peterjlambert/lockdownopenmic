  <h2>What's this now?</h2>
  <p>
    We're a group of musicians who, by and large, found eachother on the internet at the beginning of the 2020 lockdown and performed via Zoom (nearly) every Tuesday night since, until finishing what we'll call 'Season One' on 21st March, 2023.

    I started Lockdown Open Mic as an online version of our favourite local open mic nights. Over time we grew into an amazing community of performers, audience members and new friends.
  <p>
    We're a friendly bunch, and with zero pressure for members to perform at all (we have plenty of people who just joined for a weekly dose of live entertainment)</p>
  </p>
  <p>As Lockdown Open Mic (Season One) plays itself off, we'll always look back on the times we had with love and joy (and probably tears).</p>
